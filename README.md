# Overview of Project

Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:

- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data (35 points)
- Deliverable 1 Instructions
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.


Results with detail analysis:

Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data (50 points)
Deliverable 2 Instructions
Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map (15 points)
Deliverable 3 Instructions
Using your knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to your earthquake map.

# Summary: 

In this module, I used the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude has a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake has a popup marker that, when clicked, will display information about the earthquake. This project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. Tasks To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.
